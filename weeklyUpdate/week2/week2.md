## Updated User Stories
User Story:

Date#1:

Anthony, Bosh and Chris are friends and they all downloaded the “App”. Then they signed up with Gmail address, Facebook account, phone number, etc. severally. After the identifying, they all got all the free memberships of grocery stores included by “App”: Grocery-store#1, #2, #3... #n. 

Date#2:

Anthony went to Grocery-store#1 at Manhattan. After he picked everything he wants, he went to the checkout corner. He opened the “App” and showed the cashier his bar code on his phone screen. He got some discount for the stuff he bought, and then he went back home.

Bosh went to Grocery-store#2 at Manhattan.  After he picked everything he wants, he went to the checkout corner. He opened the “App” and showed the cashier his bar code on his phone screen. He got some credit for the stuff he bought, and then he went back home.

Chris went to Grocery-store#n+1 at Manhattan. Apparently, Grocery-store#n+1 didn’t cooperate with “App”. But this grocery is closer to Chris’s home, and he’s not willing to go farther this day. After he picked everything he wants, he went to the checkout corner. Since this Grocery didn’t cooperate with “App”, he couldn’t use “App” to get the benefit. He bought the stuff anyway and went back home.

Date#3:

(FDA found that ItemX sold on Date#1.5 to Date#2.5 has some quality issues, which require FDA to recall them. FDA send the alert to “App”, then “App” use their database to send the alert to specific users.)

Anthony is sitting at home, watching TV. Suddenly, he got an email/message/facebook-notificaiton from “App”, which tells him that the ItemX he bought on Date#2 has quality issues and need to be recalled. Together with email is the official info from FDA, says all ItemX sold from Date#1.5 to Date#2.5 at Manhattan has this kind of quality issue. Therefore, he discards the item and shares this info on this social software. As the return for what he does, “App” gives him some credit which will give him benefit when he go to the grocery store later.

Bosh is sitting at home, watching TV. Since he didn’t buy ItemX, he doesn’t get any message. And he finishes his movie without any interrupting.

Chris is sitting at home, watching TV. He feels a little bored and opens his social software. Suddenly he find Anthony just shared an info says that all ItemX sold from Date#1.5 to Date#2.5 at Manhattan has some kind of quality issue and need to be recalled. Then he realizes that he also did bought ItemX at Date#2 at Manhattan. He feels so lucky that he open social software in time and decide that he won’t go to a grocery store not included in “App”.
