## Notes from Crit 2

* Loyalty Managers - our critiquers suggested we meet with a supermarket's loyalty program manager and talk to them about the process
* Regarding the unwillingness of supermarkets to partner with us - why don't we try offering a double blind system? Basically, information never leaves their servers and we never see ALL the bought items, just what they bought IF they purchased something recalled
* Also - what about an NDA? Why can't we just offer to sign one, completely removing the issue of us re-using the supermarket data? What would supermarkets say about that?
* Become a trusted brand!
* They also suggested we revisit the receipt scanning idea - even if we're just matching names of items, we would still be able to narrow it down enough to give users a short list of items that they would see and then just pick the ones they had bought
